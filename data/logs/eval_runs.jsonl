The ﬁrst feature to be analyzed is the Silhouette al- gorithm. As we have expected, silhouette shape is a volatile feature and shows an extremely high EER of about 29% due to the large overlap between genuine and imposter distributions, as shown in Fig. 7. An inter- esting phenomenon is the large amount of genuine foot- prints achieving the lowest score 0 due to the sensitivity to spread toes, as "}, {"score": 0.5291354884706805, "vec_score": 0.7658251, "bm25_score": 0.0, "page": 7, "chunk": null, "chunk_size": null, "name": "f4a48a88-916a-46ac-9a29-70ee44dce5b2__Uhl08a.pdf", "text": "<start page 7> FIG. 6: Minutiae: A typical ballprint region containing 300 to 400 minutiae. 3.
