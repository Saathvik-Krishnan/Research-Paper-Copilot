It uses hybrid approaches and extends considerations to fingerprint biometrics since ridge structures are present on the foot [Source 4]. One of the methods used is Soleprint, which detects lines and creases using Prewitt kernels and extracts variances of overlapping blocks as a feature vector [Source 1]. Another method is Eigenfeet, derived from Eigenfaces, which relies on the most relevant features for classification [Source 1].\n"}
